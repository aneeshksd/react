    Knowledge Lens provides a collection of Lens that automates and simplify the discovery of hidden insights from Big Data. Our mission is to turn the dark data to meaningful business insights. We are Big Data Technology Geeks with extensive Industry expertise with wide range of Big Data Projects ranging from Big Data Engineering to Data Science.

We believe that the world’s scientists, engineers, and analysts deserve nothing but best-in-class digital technologies to help them and the life sciences companies they work for develop and manufacture life-saving therapies. That’s why our mission at gLens is to accelerate the speed to market for new therapies by helping drug development and manufacturing companies organize their data and efficiently execute their core processes. We do this by providing user-focused, domain-specific software applications that are built on leading edge technology.

We understand that our customers follow the same general processes, but each one has their own unique way of executing these processes. That’s why all of our solutions are designed from the ground up to be flexible to adapt to your terminology, data structures, and processes. It’s also why we use a microservice based architecture, so we can expand solution capabilities without disrupting critical business activities.
